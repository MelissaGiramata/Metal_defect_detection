Mechanic Component Images ( Normal / Defected)

About Dataset This dataset is of casting manufacturing products. Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mold containing a hollow cavity of the desired shape and then allowed to solidify. The reason for collecting this data is casting defects!! A casting defect is an undesired irregularity in a metal casting process. There are many types of defects in casting, like blow holes, pinholes, burrs, shrinkage defects, mold material defects, pouring metal defects, metallurgical defects, etc. Defects are an unwanted thing in the casting industry. To remove this defective product, all drive have their quality inspection department. But the main problem is this inspection process is carried out manually. It is a very time-consuming process, and due to human accuracy, this is not 100% accurate. This can be because of the rejection of the whole order. So it creates a big loss in the company.

We decided to make the inspection process automatic, and for this, we need to make a deep-learning classification model for this problem.
